# Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship Task 4**.  
Built a binary classifier using **Logistic Regression** on a custom dataset.

## 📌 Steps Implemented
1. Load and explore dataset  
2. Train/Test split and standardization  
3. Train Logistic Regression model  
4. Evaluate model (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC)  
5. Threshold tuning and sigmoid explanation  

## 📊 Results
- Evaluation metrics included in notebook  
- ROC curve plotted  
- Threshold tuning demonstrated  

## 🛠️ Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
